# instagram-bot-get_usernames

Use webdriver selenium to get a txt file with all usernames from your direct on Instagram (@username format).

To run the script:

 - download chromedriver, unzip, move to C:\webdrivers (windows) or /usr/local/bin (mac os/linux)
 - pip install selenium
 - create a information.py file with variables: 

      username = 'your_username'
      
      password = 'your_password'
      
Need some ideas to make the code roll down the direct page until the end without giving it a number on a for i in range(number) loop. 
Maybe some try and exception ... 

There are more comments inside the code for ideas and possible errors.  

Feel free to contact me or add more features to this code.  

Thanks.
